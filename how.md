three screens. Practice - Learn - Config:

- Practice: should have the screen for choosing which type of lesson (for now, definite and indefinite articles)
- Learn: should have the cheatsheet
- Config: should have things like setting dark mode and whatever else

The goal of the three screens is to have more than one usable screen

We should have bottom tab navigation

Practice screen should have stack navigation.
The first screen should be the exercice selection (maybe like the duolingo lessons). After selection we should go to the exercise
